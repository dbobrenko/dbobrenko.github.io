# Deep RL

While deep learning (DL) made a revolution in computer vision (<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf">Link 1</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1.pdf">Link 2</a>), reinforcement learning (RL) also doesn't stand by. A few years ago, a group of smart people from <a href="https://deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a>, combined this two fields of studies in their <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">work</a>, and trained a single convolutional neural network to play different Atari games from raw screen pixels!
